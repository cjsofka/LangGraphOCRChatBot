3-6. Programmable logic controllers
‘The recommended controller for SCADA systems is the programmable logic controller (PLC). PLCs are
‘general-purpose microprocessor based controllers that provide logic, timing, counting, and analog control
with network communications capability,

a. PLCs are recommended for the following reasons:

(1) They were developed for the factory floor and have demonstrated high reliability and tolerance
for heat, vibration, and electromagnetic interference.

(2) Their widespread market penetration means that parts are readily available and programming
and technical support services are available from a large number of control system integrators.

(3) They provide
applications

h speed processing, which is important in generator and switchgear control

(4) They support hot standby and triple-redundant configurations for high reliability applications,

b. APLC consists of the required quantities of the following types of modules or cards, mounted on a
‘common physical support and electrical interconnection structure known as a rack. A ty
configuration is shown in figure 3-4

(1) Power supply: The power supply converts facility electrical distribution voltage, such as 120
VAC or 125 VDC to signal level voltage used by the processor and other modules.

(2) Processor: The processor module contains the microprocessor that performs control functions
and computations, as well as the memory required to store the program,

(3) Input/Output (1/0): These modules provide the means of connecting the processor to the field *
devices.

(4) Communications: Communications modules are available for a wide range of industry-standard
‘communication network connections. These allow digital data transfer between PLCs and to other sys
tems within the facility. Some PLCs have communications capability built-in to the processor, rather than
using separate modules.

(5) Communication Media and Protocols: ‘The most common communication media used are cop-
per-wire, coaxial, fiber-optics, and wireless. The most common “open” communication protocols are
Ethemet, Ethernev/IP, and DeviceNet. “Open” systems generally provide “plug and play” features in
hich the system software automatically recognizes and communicates to any compatible device that is
connected to it. Other widely accepted open protocols are Modbus, Profibus, and ControlNet.

(6) Redundancy: Many PLCs are capable of being configured for redundant operation in which one
processor backs up another. This arrangement often requires the addition of a redundancy module, which
provides status confirmation and control assertion between the processors. In addition, signal wiring to
redundant racks is an option.
