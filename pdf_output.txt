CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 
 
1-1.  Purpose 
 
The purpose of this publication is to provide guidance for facilities managers and engineers in selection, 
design, installation, commissioning, and operation and maintenance of supervisory control and data ac-
quisition (SCADA) systems for command, control, communications, computer, intelligence, surveillance 
and reconnaissance (C4ISR) facilities.  SCADA systems provide control and monitoring of the mechani-
cal and electrical utility systems serving the mission critical loads.  Although this technical manual (TM) 
is written primarily for C4ISR facilities and reflects the high reliability required for those facilities, it may 
also be used a reference for similar systems in other facility types.   
 
1-2.  Scope 
 
The fundamental concepts of control systems, including industry standards and definitions are presented 
as an introduction to the subject.  Topics covered include system architecture, network communication 
methods, reliability considerations, operator interfaces, and commissioning.  Control system architecture 
review and recommended SCADA configurations for typical small, medium, and large facilities are pre-
sented.  Special reliability and threat-resistance considerations governing SCADA systems are discussed.  
Operational issues including commissioning, maintenance practices and requirements for SCADA system 
documentation are also presented. 
 
1-3.  References 
 
A complete list of references with citations is included in appendix A. Selection, design, installation, and 
commissioning of SCADA systems should always be based on the most current relevant edition of the 
standards listed in the references.  Where the recommendations of this manual and the referenced stan-
dards differ, the more stringent requirement should be followed. 
 
1-4.  Currency 
 
Because SCADA systems make extensive use of electronic technology, the technology cycle can be very 
short, and recommendations regarding specific types of hardware, software,  communications protocols, 
etc. in this TM may no longer represent the state of the art  several years following publication.  Selection 
of SCADA systems should consider the advantages obtained from application of advanced technologies, 
but must assure that the newer technologies considered comply with the principles identified in this TM 
for reliability and threat-resistance and have a demonstrated history in field service adequate to assure the 
attainment of design reliability criteria.

CHAPTER 2 
FUNDAMENTALS OF CONTROL 
 
2-1. General control 
 
Control consists of monitoring the state of a critical parameter, detecting when it varies from the desired 
state, and taking action to restore it.  Control can be discrete or analog, manual or automatic, and periodic 
or continuous.  Some terms that are commonly used in describing control systems are defined below.  
Additional terms are included in the glossary in appendix B: 
  
a. The process variable is the parameter that is to be controlled.  Examples of process variables in 
C4ISR systems are the temperature in a given space, the pressure produced by a cooling water pumping 
system, or the voltage maintained by a standby generator.  To be controlled, the process variable must be 
capable of being measured and that measurement converted into a signal that can be acted on by the con-
troller.  
 
b. Devices that measure process variables are transducers or sensors.  Examples are a pressure switch 
that closes a set of contacts when air pressure in a supply line drops below a set value, or a watt trans-
ducer that converts a measurement of the electrical power produced by a generator into a low current sig-
nal proportional to power. In many cases, the process variable sensor consists of a direct measurement 
device, called an element and a separate signal processor called a transmitter.  An example of this would 
be temperature measurement using a resistive temperature detector, or RTD, as the element and a tem-
perature transmitter, which converts the varying resistance value of the RTD into a current or voltage pro-
portional to the temperature.    
 
c. The setpoint is the desired value of the process variable, normally preset into the control system by 
an operator, or derived as an output of another control calculation.  The error signal is the difference be-
tween the process variable and the setpoint, and is the basis for control action.  The controller is the de-
vice that processes the error signal, determines the required control action, and provides a control output 
to the process. 
 
d. The control output usually must act on the system through another device to effect the desired con-
trol action, such as varying the position of a valve, the speed of a motor, or the current through a heating 
element.  The device that converts the control output into control action is the actuator.   
 
2-2. Discrete control 
 
Discrete control deals with systems in which each element can only exist in certain defined states.  An 
example of discrete control would be starting an exhaust fan when the temperature in a space exceeds a 
preset value and stopping the fan when the temperature falls below a lower preset value.  The temperature 
(process variable) is either within the acceptable range, or outside of it.  The fan control relay (actuator) is 
either on or off.  This type of control is implemented with logic diagrams and circuits.  In discrete control, 
even though some of  the parameters actually have a continuous range of values, the only information 
used by the control system is whether their value is greater than, less than, or equal to some desired value.  
A block diagram of a simple discrete control system is shown in figure 2-1.  The devices used to sense 
system conditions in discrete control are typically electrical switches, with contacts that are open when 
the variable is in one state and closed when it is in the other.  Similarly, the control action is typically pro-
duced by control relays, which open or close contacts in the control circuits of motors, valve actuators, or 
other devices.

Figure 2-1.  Discrete control system block diagram   
 
2-3. Analog control  
 
Analog control deals with systems in which variables can have a continuous range of values, rather than 
simply discrete states.  Basic analog control consists of the process of measuring the actual output of a 
system, comparing it to the desired value of that output, and taking control action based on the difference 
to cause the output to return to the desired value. This process can be as simple as the driver of an auto-
mobile comparing the speedometer reading (process variable) to the speed limit (setpoint) and adjusting 
the position of the accelerator pedal (control action) to speed up or slow down the vehicle accordingly.  In 
most systems we are concerned with, this type of control action is performed automatically by electronic 
processors, which receive signals from sensors, process them, and provide signals to pumps, valves, mo-
tors, or other devices to effect control action.  Figure 2-2 shows a block diagram of a basic analog control 
system.

TM 5-601 
 
2-3 
 
2-4. Classes of analog controllers 
 
Analog controllers can be classified by the relationship between the error signal input to them and the 
control action they produce: 
 
a. Proportional (P) controllers produce an output that is directly proportional to the error signal.  A 
defining characteristic of P control is that the error signal must always be non-zero to produce a control 
action; therefore, proportional control alone cannot return the process to setpoint following an external 
disturbance.  This non-zero error signal that is characteristic of P controllers is the steady-state offset.  
The adjustable value of the proportionality constant of a P controller is the gain.  The higher the gain, the 
greater the control action for a given error signal and the faster the response.  An example of a P control-
ler is a governor on an engine-generator operating in droop mode, in which the governor opens the fuel 
valve proportionately to the difference between the desired revolutions per minute (RPM) setpoint and 
actual RPM; as load on the generator increases, RPM decreases and the governor increases the fuel flow 
to allow the engine to carry the additional load.  Similarly, as load decreases, RPM increases and the gov-
ernor responds by reducing fuel flow to match the new load condition.  For any condition other than no-
load, the actual RPM will be slightly different from the setpoint RPM (steady-state offset).  
 
b. Proportional plus Integral (PI) controllers produce a control action that is proportional to the error 
signal plus the integral of the error signal.  The addition of the integrator allows the controller to eliminate 
the steady state offset, and return the process variable to the setpoint value.  The adjustable value of the 
integration constant of the PI controller is called the reset, because it has the effect of resetting the error 
signal to zero.  An engine governor operating in isochronous mode, in which constant RPM is maintained 
over the full load range, uses PI control to accomplish this. 
 
c. Proportional plus Integral plus Derivative (PID) controllers add a component of control action that 
is proportional to the derivative of the error signal, or the rate at which the error signal is changing. This 
mode of control allows the controller to anticipate changes in the process variable by increasing control 
action for rapid changes, making it useful for systems that require very fast response times, or are inher-
ently unstable without the controller.  The adjustable value of the derivative constant in a PID controller is 
the rate.  
 
2-5. Control loops  
 
The complete control scheme required to control a single process variable or a group of related process 
variables is called a control loop.  The control loop includes the relevant part of the process, the process 
variable sensor and associated transmitter(s), the input signals, the controller, the control output signal, 
and the actuator.  Once defined, the control loop serves as the basis for both labeling of devices and docu-
mentation of wiring and control strategy (refer to chapter 10).  The process of adjusting the gain, reset, 
and rate parameters to obtain effective and stable response of the system to changes in the setpoint or ex-
ternal disturbances is called loop tuning, and is an essential aspect of control system startup and commis-
sioning.  
 

TM 5-601 
 
2-4 
2-6. Types of controllers 
 
Control can be implemented using either individual standalone controllers, known as single-loop control-
lers, or by combining multiple control loops into a larger controller.  Single-loop controllers have provi-
sions for a process variable input signal, a control output signal, setpoint adjustment, tuning of the PID 
control parameters, and typically include some type of display of the value of the process variable and the 
setpoint.  They are compact, panel mounted devices that may be used effectively when only a small num-
ber of control loops is involved.  With some exceptions, single-loop controllers are not typically used in 
C4ISR SCADA systems.  The basic controller used in C4ISR SCADA systems should be programmable 
logic controllers (PLCs), which are microprocessor-based systems having provisions for multiple inputs 
and outputs, both discrete and analog control capability, advanced human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and 
network communications capability.  These controllers are in more detail in chapter 3.

CHAPTER 3 
SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
3-1. General 
 
Control system architecture can range from simple local control to highly redundant distributed control.  
SCADA systems, by definition, apply to facilities that are large enough that a central control system is 
necessary.  Reliability criteria for C4ISR facilities dictate the application of redundant or distributed cen-
tral control systems. 
 
3-2. Local control 
 
Figure 3-1 describes a system architecture in which sensors, controller, and controlled equipment are 
within close proximity and the scope of each controller is limited to a specific system or subsystem.  Lo-
cal controllers are typically capable of accepting inputs from a supervisory controller to initiate or termi-
nate locally-controlled automatic sequences, or to adjust control setpoints, but the control action itself is 
determined in the local controller.  Required operator interfaces and displays are also local.  This provides 
a significant advantage for an operator troubleshooting a problem with the system, but requires the opera-
tor to move around the facility to monitor systems or respond to system contingencies.  Examples of local 
control are the packaged control panels furnished with chillers or skid-mounted pump packages.

TM 5-601 
 
3-2 
3-3. Centralized control 
 
Centralized control describes a system in which all sensors, actuators, and other equipment within the fa-
cility are connected to a single controller or group of controllers located in a common control room.  Lo-
cating all controls, operator interfaces and indicators in a single control room improves operator knowl-
edge of system conditions and speeds response to contingencies.  This type of system architecture was 
common for power plants and other facilities using single-loop controllers or early digital controls in the 
past, but it has now been largely supplanted by distributed control because of the high cost associated 
with routing and installing all control system wiring to a central location.  Centralized control systems 
should only be considered for small C4ISR facilities and if used, must have fully redundant processors.  
Where redundancy is provided in a centralized control system segregated wiring pathways must be pro-
vided to assure that control signals to and from equipment or systems that are redundant are not subject to 
common failure from electrical fault, physical or environmental threats (figure 3-2).   
 
 
Figure 3-2.  Centralized control system architecture 
 
3-4. Distributed control 
 
Distributed control system architecture (figure 3-3) offers the best features of both local control and cen-
tralized control.  In a distributed control system, controllers are provided locally to systems or groups of 
equipment, but networked to one or more operator stations in a central location through a digital commu-
nication circuit.  Control action for each system or subsystem takes place in the local controller, but the 
central operator station has complete visibility of the status of all systems and the input and output data in 
each controller, as well as the ability to intervene in the control logic of the local controllers if necessary.

Figure 3-3.  Distributed control system architecture 
 
a. There are a number of characteristics of distributed control architecture which enhance reliability: 
 
(1) Input and output wiring runs are short and less vulnerable to physical disruption or electromag-
netic interference. 
 
(2) A catastrophic environmental failure in one area of the facility will not affect controllers or wir-
ing located in another area. 
 
(3) Each local controller can function on its own upon loss of communication with the central con-
troller. 
 
b. There are also specific threats introduced by distributed control architecture that must be addressed 
in the design of the system: 
 
(1) Networks used for communication may become electronically compromised from outside the 
facility. 
 
(2) Interconnection of controllers in different locations can produce ground loop and surge voltage 
problems. 
 

TM 5-601 
 
3-4 
(3) If the central controller is provided with the ability to directly drive the output of local control-
lers for purposes of operator intervention, software glitches in the central controller have the potential to 
affect multiple local controllers, compromising system redundancy. 
 
(4) Distributed control system architecture redundancy must mirror the redundancy designed into 
the mechanical and electrical systems of the facility.  Where redundant mechanical or electrical systems 
are provided, they should be provided with dedicated controllers, such that failure of a single controller 
cannot affect more than one system.  Equipment or systems that are common to multiple redundant sub-
systems or pathways, (such as generator paralleling switchgear) should be provided with redundant con-
trollers.   
 
3-5. Types of distributed control systems 
 
    a. Plant distributed control system (DCS): While the term DCS applies in general to any system in 
which controllers are distributed rather than centralized, in the power generation and petrochemical proc-
ess industries it has come to refer to a specific type of control system able to execute complex analog 
process control algorithms at high speed, as well as provide routine monitoring, reporting and data log-
ging functions. In most applications, the input and output modules of the system are distributed through-
out the facility, but the control processors themselves are centrally located in proximity to the control 
room. These systems typically use proprietary hardware, software and communication protocols, requir-
ing that both replacement parts and technical support be obtained from the original vendor.   
 
    b. Direct digital control (DDC): DDC systems are used in the commercial building heating, ventilation 
and air conditioning (HVAC) industry to monitor and maintain environmental conditions. They consist of 
local controllers connected to a network with a personal computer (PC) based central station which pro-
vides monitoring, reporting, data storage and programming capabilities. The controllers are optimized for 
economical HVAC system control, which generally does not require fast execution speeds. Their hard-
ware and control software are proprietary, with either proprietary or open protocols used for network 
communication. 
 
    c. Remote terminal unit (RTU) based SCADA: RTU-based systems are common in the electric, gas and 
water distribution industries where monitoring and control must take place across large geographical dis-
tances. The RTUs were developed primarily to provide monitoring and control capability at unattended 
sites such as substations, metering stations, pump stations, and water towers. They communicate with a 
central station over telephone lines, fiber-optics, radio or microwave transmission. Monitored sites tend to 
be relatively small, with the RTU typically used mainly for monitoring and only limited control. Hard-
ware and software are proprietary, with either proprietary or open protocols used for data transmission to 
the central station.  
 
    d. Programmable logic controller (PLC) based systems: PLCs, which are described in greater detail in 
the next section, can be networked together to share data as well as provide centralized monitoring and 
control capability. Control systems consisting of networked PLCs are supplanting both the plant DCS and 
the RTU-based systems in many industries. They were developed for factory automation and have tradi-
tionally excelled at high speed discrete control, but have now been provided with analog control capabil-
ity as well. Hardware for these systems is proprietary, but both control software and network communica-
tion protocols are open, allowing system configuration, programming and technical support for a particu-
lar manufacturer’s equipment to be obtained from many sources.

3-6. Programmable logic controllers 
 
The recommended controller for SCADA systems is the programmable logic controller (PLC).  PLCs are 
general-purpose microprocessor based controllers that provide logic, timing, counting, and analog control 
with network communications capability.   
 
a. PLCs are recommended for the following reasons: 
 
  (1)  They were developed for the factory floor and have demonstrated high reliability and tolerance 
for heat, vibration, and electromagnetic interference. 
 
(2) Their widespread market penetration means that parts are readily available and programming 
and technical support services are available from a large number of control system integrators. 
 
(3) They provide high speed processing, which is important in generator and switchgear control 
applications. 
 
(4) They support hot standby and triple-redundant configurations for high reliability applications. 
 
b. A PLC consists of the required quantities of the following types of modules or cards, mounted on a 
common physical support and electrical interconnection structure known as a rack.  A typical PLC rack 
configuration is shown in figure 3-4. 
 
(1) Power supply: The power supply converts facility electrical distribution voltage, such as 120 
VAC or 125 VDC to signal level voltage used by the processor and other modules. 
 
(2) Processor: The processor module contains the microprocessor that performs control functions 
and computations, as well as the memory required to store the program. 
 
(3) Input/Output (I/O): These modules provide the means of connecting the processor to the field 
devices. 
 
(4) Communications: Communications modules are available for a wide range of industry-standard 
communication network connections.  These allow digital data transfer between PLCs and to other sys-
tems within the facility.  Some PLCs have communications capability built-in to the processor, rather than 
using separate modules. 
 
(5) Communication Media and Protocols:  The most common communication media used are cop-
per-wire, coaxial, fiber-optics, and wireless.  The most common “open” communication protocols are 
Ethernet, Ethernet/IP, and DeviceNet.  “Open” systems generally provide “plug and play” features in 
which the system software automatically recognizes and communicates to any compatible device that is 
connected to it.  Other widely accepted open protocols are Modbus, Profibus, and ControlNet. 
 
(6) Redundancy: Many PLCs are capable of being configured for redundant operation in which one 
processor backs up another.  This arrangement often requires the addition of a redundancy module, which 
provides status confirmation and control assertion between the processors.  In addition, signal wiring to 
redundant racks is an option. 

TM 5-601 
 
3-6 
 
Figure 3-4.  Typical PLC rack 
 
c. All software and programming required for the PLC to operate as a standalone controller is main-
tained on-board in the processor.  PLCs are programmed with one of the following standard programming 
languages: 
 
(1) Ladder Diagrams:  Used primarily for logic (Boolean) operations and is easily understood by 
electricians and control technicians.  This is the most commonly used language in the United States and is 
supported by all PLC suppliers. 
 
(2) Function Block Diagrams:  Used primarily for intensive analog control (PID) operations and is 
available only in “high-end” PLC’s.  It is more commonly used outside the United States. 
 
(3) Sequential Function Chart:  Used primarily for batch control operations and is available only in 
“high-end” PLC’s. 
 
(4) Structured Text:  Used primarily by PLC programmers with a computer language background 
and is supported only in “high-end” PLC’s.  
 
 
d. SCADA PLCs should be specified to be programmed using ladder diagrams.  This language is very 
common, and duplicates in format traditional electrical schematics, making it largely understandable by 
electricians and technicians without specific PLC training.  The ladder logic functions the same as equiva-
lent hard-wired relays.  The PLCs in a SCADA system will be networked to one or more central personal 
computer (PC) workstations, which provide the normal means of human machine interface (HMI) to the 
system.  These PCs will be provided with Windows-based HMI software that provides a graphical user 
interface (GUI) to the control system in which information is presented to the operator on graphic screens 
that are custom-configured to match the facility systems.  For example, the electrical system status may 
be shown on a one-line diagram graphic in which open circuit breakers are colored green, closed breakers 
are colored red, and voltage and current values are displayed adjacent to each bus or circuit breaker. 
 
3-7. Redundant PLCs 
 
Where redundant PLC Systems are required, they may utilize a warm standby, hot standby, or voting con-
figuration.  Figure 3-5 shows a typical system configuration for redundant PLCs in either warm or hot 
standby.  Both processors have continuous access to the I/O over redundant buses or networks, and regis-
ter data and status information are exchanged over a dedicated fiber optic link.  In warm standby configu-

TM 5-601 
 
 
3-7 
ration, the primary processor is running the program and controlling the output states.  Upon failure of the 
primary processor, the standby processor takes over and begins to run the program.  In a hot standby con-
figuration, both processors are running continuously with their program scans synchronized over the fiber 
optic link.  If one processor fails, the other takes control with a “bumpless” transfer in which the outputs 
do not change state.  The hot standby configuration is recommended for most SCADA applications.  For 
highly critical applications, a triple-redundant voting scheme, shown in figure 3-6, may be used.  In this 
configuration three processors run continuously with synchronized scans, using either shared input data or 
independent input data from redundant sensors.  The outputs of the processors pass through a two-out-of-
three (2oo3) voter to select the control value to the process.  A spare voter prevents this from becoming an 
opportunity for a single point of failure.

3-8. Safety PLCs 
 
A recommended means of assuring that PLC hardware and software meet specified reliability criteria is 
through specification of PLCs that are certified for use in Safety Instrumented Systems according to IEC 
61508.  This standard, while intended for application to protective systems used in manufacturing, chemi-
cal, and nuclear facilities, represents the only independently verified criteria for PLC reliability and diag-
nostic capability.  PLCs meeting the requirements of this standard must have diagnostic coverage for fail-
ure of the power supply, processor and input and output modules.  They must also have been shown to 
provide a minimum reliability level defined in terms of probability of failure on demand (PFD), or prob-
ability of failure per hour (PFPH).  Safety integrity level (SIL) target reliability indices for PLCs in low-
demand operation modes (such as controlling a standby power system) are given in table 3-1.  For PLCs 
in continuous operation (such as controlling a base load power plant), the corresponding SIL levels are 
given in table 3-2.  These values can be used in conjunction with the reliability analysis techniques de-
scribed in chapter 5 to determine the required SIL for a specific application.

3-9. Recommended configurations 
 
Three levels of SCADA system architecture are recommended to support C4ISR facilities.  These vary in 
configuration to correspond to the size, criticality, and amount of mechanical and electrical equipment 
installed in the facility as noted. 
 
a. The small system is recommended to support a remote data and/or telephone switch site.  Such a 
facility would generally include a single service transformer and a single standby diesel generator.  
Equipment inside would consist of a small rectifier for a 48 VDC bus, a small inverter, and two or more 
stand-alone direct-expansion cooling units.  Systems for these facilities may not achieve the reliabil-
ity/availability criteria specified for larger facilities.  The level of SCADA system redundancy should re-
flect the mechanical/electrical system redundancy.  See figure 3-7 for a suggested configuration.   

TM 5-601

Figure 3-7.  Small facility SCADA system 
 
 
b. The medium system is recommended to support a main computer facility, which would include 
multiple service transformers and standby generators  with paralleling switchgear , one or two large UPS 
systems, and multiple refrigeration machines with asso ciated auxiliary equipment.  SCADA systems for 
this size facility should utilize redundant distributed  control architecture.  The level of PLC redundancy 
should be selected based on the design of the mechan ical and electrical systems.  Two options and sug-
gested SCADA configurations are provided.

Figure 3-8.  Medium facility SCADA system – redundant M/E systems 
 
c. Figure 3-8 presents a suggested SCADA configuration applicable to a facility with mechanical and 
electrical systems designed to provide redundancy through segregated systems.  In this case, PLCs con-
trolling individual systems must have a reliability level adequate to maintain the required availability at 
the system they serve, but do not necessarily have to be redundant, as redundancy is provided through the 
N+X system approach.  Failure of a single PLC will affect only the system it controls and the remaining 
systems continue to meet the mission-critical load.

Figure 3-9.  Medium facility SCADA system – redundant M/E components 
 
d. Figure 3-9 presents a suggested SCADA configuration for a similarly sized facility in which me-
chanical and electrical systems utilize redundant components in a manifold configuration.  In this design, 
any combination of components can be selected to serve the load.  This provides greater flexibility than 
segregating components into redundant systems, but requires common control of all components, making 

TM 5-601 
 
3-12 
the PLC a potential single point of failure.  In this configuration, system-level PLCs must have redun-
dancy adequate to meet the required availability of the system. 
 
e. A large system serving a multi-facility site consisting of several installations will require a central 
supervisory control room networked to distributed control within the individual buildings appropriate to 
the mission and reliability criteria of each facility.  A control room will typically be located in each cen-
tral power plant that is required for such a facility and the system can also be accessed from other loca-
tions distributed along the network.  Redundant and segregated pathways are recommended for the on-site 
communication network.  See figure 3-10 for a suggested configuration.

CHAPTER 4 
COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY 
 
4-1. General communications 
 
Communication networks may be used in SCADA systems to pass data between field devices and PLCs, 
between different PLCs, or between PLCs and personal computers used for operator interface, data proc-
essing and storage, or management information.  Although a communications circuit can involve only two 
pieces of equipment with a circuit between them, the term network typically refers to connecting many 
devices together to permit sharing of data between devices over a single (or redundant) circuits.  Data is 
transmitted over a network using serial communication, in which words of data called bytes consisting of 
individual logical zeros and ones (bits) are transmitted sequentially from one device to another.  The col-
lection of data in a single transmission is often called a packet.  The rate at which data can be transmitted 
over a network is defined in bits-per-second or bps, but typically expressed in thousands (Kbps) or mil-
lions (Mbps).   
 
a. In large SCADA systems, there is usually a communications network of some type connecting the 
individual PLCs to the operator interface equipment at the central control room.  There may also be net-
works used at lower levels in the control system architecture, for communications between different PLCs 
in the same subsystem or facility, as well as for communications between field devices and individual 
PLCs.  Figure 4-1 shows the various levels of network communications in a typical large SCADA system.   
 
 
 
Figure 4-1.  Typical SCADA network levels 

TM 5-601 
 
4-2 
 
b. Although not widely applied to SCADA systems, two terms that are commonly used with respect to 
management information systems communication are local area network (LAN) and wide area network 
(WAN).  A LAN consists of all of the devices, typically PCs and servers within a particular facility or site.  
A WAN is created by providing a connection between LANs, typically over a long geographic distance 
using telecommunications facilities.  Large SCADA systems may be required to interface to LANs or 
WANs to provide data transfer to management information systems or to permit internet access to 
SCADA system data. 
 
4-2. Physical media 
 
All communications networks utilize one of two media to transmit data signals between devices: Electri-
cal conductors such as copper wire or optical conductors such as fiber optic cable (wireless communica-
tion via radio or microwave radiation does not require an intervening medium).  The point on a device at 
which the circuit is connected is referred to as a communications port; the physical and electrical charac-
teristics of the communications port must match the media to be used for the network. 
 
a. Copper media will support either point-to-point or tapped network configurations.  Copper-based 
networks may be used between devices and PLCs or between PLCs, but should not be installed over long 
distances, or across a facility boundary.  All copper network cables should be of shielded construction.  
For copper-based networks, three basic types of copper conductors are used. 
 
(1) Shielded twisted pair (STP), in which individual pairs of insulated conductors are twisted to-
gether to reduce inductively coupled interference and covered with a continuous metallic foil shield to 
reduce capacitive coupled interference.  Individual pairs or multiple pairs are then assembled into a cable 
within an overall jacket that provides environmental protection. 
 
(2) Unshielded twisted pair (UTP), have individual pairs of insulated conductors that are twisted 
together to reduce inductively coupled interference.  Individual pairs or multiple pairs are then assembled 
into a cable with an overall jacket to provide environmental protection. 
 
(3) Coaxial cable (COAX) has a single conductor that is surrounded by an annular layer of dielec-
tric material that is then covered with a metallic braided shield and then an overall jacket.  Configurations 
are available with multiple coaxial cables within a common overall jacket; these are often referred to as 
twin-ax (2 cables) or tri-ax (3 cables).  Coaxial cable construction is inherently shielded. 
 
b. In fiber-based networks, optical fibers transmit data in the form of pulses of light, which are pro-
duced by a light emitting diode (LED) or laser transmitter and detected by a photodiode or phototransistor 
receiver at the other end of the fiber.  In addition to these photoelectric components, fiber optic transceiv-
ers contain the circuitry required to convert electronic data into pulses of light and the reverse.  Each opti-
cal fiber consists of a glass fiber core with another layer of glass over the core called cladding.  The core 
and cladding have different indexes of refraction, causing light waves that enter the core to be continu-
ously reflected from the interface and not dispersed outside the core.  Cable sizes are typically defined by 
the outside diameters of the core and cladding in microns, such as 62.5/125.  Optical fiber is available in 
two types: 
 
(1) Single Mode Fiber, consisting of a single core strand having a single transmission path, pro-
vides very high data transmission rates over long distances, but is costly.  This type of cable is used for 
long-distance telecommunications and video application.   

TM 5-601 
 
 
4-3 
(2) Multi-Mode Fiber, consisting of multiple core strands, provides multiple signal paths which re-
sult in some distortion of the signal and is therefore restricted to shorter lengths, but is more economical.  
This is the type of cable commonly used in SCADA system and data processing networks.    
 
c. SCADA networks operating between facilities on large sites, over long distances, or outside of the 
facility HEMP shield should be fiber-based.  Fiber-based networks have some significant advantages for 
SCADA application, including the following. 
 
(1) They provide very high signal quality. 
 
(2) As no electric voltage or current is used, they are completely free of RFI and EMI interference. 
 
(3) When used over long distances or between buildings they eliminate problems with ground po-
tential differences, ground loops, and transient voltages. 
 
(4) They provide enhanced security since point-to-point communications cannot be tapped or daisy 
chained. 
 
4-3. Media standards 
 
Industry standards for communications media define both the physical and electrical (or optical) charac-
teristics of both the conductors and the connectors used to mate them to communications ports.  Some 
common network conductor physical standards and their characteristics are listed in table 4-1.

4-4. Communication protocols 
 
Communication protocols define the “rules” by which devices on a network are able to communicate. 
They define the structure of data packets that are transmitted on the network as well as other necessary 
information such as how individual devices are uniquely addressed, what signals the beginning and end of 
a data message, and how each message is checked for transmission errors by the receiving device.  A par-

TM 5-601 
 
4-4 
ticular communication protocol may be implemented using more than one type of physical media.  For 
example, Ethernet may operate on UTP, coaxial cable or fiber, but the data structure is the same on any of 
these media.  The protocol used may impose limitations on the media such as maximum data transmission 
rate (Mbps) or maximum circuit length between devices. 
 
a. Protocols may be either proprietary or open.  Proprietary protocols are those developed by vendors 
for use with their own systems and for which application information is not made publicly available for 
use by other vendors.  Open protocols are those for which all application information is in the public do-
main, permitting any vendor to develop devices and software that can use the protocol.  Most of the open 
protocols used today originated with specific vendors.  However, they have been made accessible by 
those vendors to increase the number of devices that are compatible with their systems, making them 
more marketable.  Table 4-2 shows common open network communication protocols. 
 
b. SCADA systems for C4ISR facilities should use open protocols for a number of reasons: 
 
(1) There is substantial published data regarding their reliability and performance characteristics. 
 
(2) Technical support is available from multiple sources. 
 
(3) There are larger numbers of competing compatible devices to select from. 
 
(4) Systems may be modified or expanded without requiring sole-source proprietary contracts.

4-5. Network topologies 
 
Commonly used network topologies include star, ring and tapped configurations.  A logical network is 
defined as a group of interconnected devices that are communicating together with the same protocol.  
Different logical networks may be interconnected by using protocol converters or translators. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

TM 5-601 
 
 
4-5 
a. In a star topology, each device on the network is connected to a central hub by a single communica-
tions circuit, as shown in figure 4-2.  The hub perf orms the function of passing messages between de-
vices.  Types of devices that may serve as the hub of  a star network include repeaters, switches and 
routers.  The most common example of this topology is  the Ethernet LAN used to interconnect all of the 
personal computers within an office environment.  In  this case, a dedicated cable is routed from the 
Ethernet port on each PC back to a switch or router so mewhere in the office building.  In a star network, 
loss of a single communication circuit affects only the single device at the end of that circuit, although 
loss of a hub device obviously affects the entire networ k.  The star network has the highest installation 
cost per device.

TM 5-601 
 
4-6 
b. In a ring topology, two communication ports are provided on each device and the network circuit 
makes a loop through all of the devices, with an open point, as shown in figure 4-3.  Two-way communi-
cation allows messages to pass in either direction along the network.  Messages must be passed through 
the communication ports of each device on the network, making it vulnerable to a break if a single device 
fails or is removed.  If a means is provided to bridge the open point on failure of a particular device or 
circuit segment, this configuration can have high reliability at relatively low cost.

TM 5-601 
 
 
4-7 
c. In a tapped (or multi-drop) network the communications circuit is tapped to be connected to each 
device so that the communication ports of the various devices are effectively electrically in parallel.  
Tapped connections are applicable only to copper-based media; fiber optic circuits are limited to point-to-
point operation.  The configuration in figure 4-4 typically represents the lowest installed cost per device.  
This configuration is commonly used for field device communications; a common example is a fire detec-
tion system with addressable devices, in which a UTP network is T-tapped at each device. 
 
 
 
Figure 4-4.  Tapped network topology 
 
4-6. Network redundancy   
 
The need for network redundancy in a SCADA system is dependent on the ro bustness and vulnerabilities 
of the type of network used as well as the criticality of  the control or reporting functions that rely on the 
network.  In a system where the network serves onl y to pass management information reporting or trend-
ing of data to a central location, and all automatic control and operator interface functions are fully pre-
sent with the network out of service, a non-redundant configuration is acceptable.  If a network serves 
only a single redundant component of a system, such as the point-to-point communication circuit between 
a generator PLC located in the control room and th e local engine control pa nel, network redundancy is 
also not required.  Any network, however, that is required for system operation,  or whose failure could 
affect multiple redundant sub-systems or components,  must be redundant.  For example, a communica-
tions network used to pass information (such as genera tor start signals) between all of the generator PLCs 
and the system master PLC must provide redundancy. 
 
 
 

TM 5-601 
 
4-8 
a. In a either a star or a tapped network, redundancy requires complete duplication of the network, in-
cluding communication ports at each device, communication circuits, and the hub equipment.  Figure 4-5 
presents an example of a fully redundant network configuration.  In this configuration, one network 
serves as the primary with all devices using it for communication.  If any (or all devices) sense loss of 
communications with the primary network, they automatically transfer to the backup network.  This pro-
vides protection both against loss of the entire primary network and loss of an individual device connec-
tion.  A bridge is required between the two networks to allow a device that has transferred to the backup 
network to communicate to those remaining on the primary network.  An advantage of this configuration 
is that each device requires only a single address, as it only communicates with one network at a time.

TM 5-601

b. The reliability of a ring network can be increased by providing an automatic switching device at  
the open point.  The switching device periodically polls the other devices on the network and detects an 
open point due to device or communication circuit failure by the lack of response from particular devices.  
The switch is then automatically closed, restoring communications between all devices.  This is referred 
to as a “self-healing” ring as shown in figure 4-6.  This provides a network that is more reliable than any 
of the non-redundant configurations, at less cost than a fully redundant configuration, and may be accept-
able for facilities with lower RAM criteria. 
 
Figure 4-6.  Self-healing ring network 
 
4-7. Network speed   
 
The speed at which information can be transmitted on a communications network depends upon the pro-
tocol, the physical media, the number of devices on the network and the level of message traffic.  Tradi-
tionally, the networks associated with SCADA systems have provided adequate speed for alarm and 
status reporting and operator control, but were not fast enough for critical functions like protective relay 
tripping or under frequency load shedding.  Advances in electrical utility substation automation have led 
to testing and qualification of some network systems to speeds adequate for protective relay trip functions 
(4 milliseconds) under specified traffic levels.  However, before considering a SCADA system that relies 
upon the network for critical control and protection functions, the user must verify that the hardware and 
software to be used has been tested and demonstrated the required speed under worst-case traffic condi-
tions.

CHAPTER 5 
RELIABILITY CONSIDERATIONS 
 
5-1. Reliability criteria 
 
Mechanical and electrical support systems for C4ISR facilities are required to be designed to attain a reli-
ability/availability (R/A) of 0.999999.  SCADA systems are integral to the function of the mechanical and 
electrical support systems and must therefore be designed to support this R/A goal.  A mechani-
cal/electrical system configuration that meets this criterion based on analysis of the process flow diagram 
or the electrical one-line will not achieve it if the control system compromises the reliability/availability 
designed into the process. 
 
a. Reliability defines the probability of a system serving its function or being able to perform its mis-
sion over a certain fixed period of time.  A system having a reliability of 0.999999 for a specific mission 
time has a 99.9999% chance of functioning without failure over that period. 
 
b. Availability defines the long-term fraction of time that a system is functioning properly or able to 
perform its mission.  A system with availability of 0.999999 will have an average downtime of only 31 
seconds per calendar year.  This does NOT mean that the average outage of the system will last 31 sec-
onds; it only means that the number of expected failures per year multiplied by the average outage length 
equals 31 seconds per year.  For example, a probability of a failure occurring once every 40 years, with an 
average duration of 20 minutes, would be more typical of a facility with an availability of 0.999999.  
Given their continuous operation and lack of a defined mission time, availability is generally a more ap-
propriate design criterion than reliability for SCADA systems. 
 
5-2. Reliability calculations 
 
If the time, t, over which a system must operate and the underlying distributions of failures for its con-
stituent elements are known, then the system reliability can be calculated by taking the integral (essen-
tially the area under the curve defined by the failure distribution) from t to infinity, as shown in equation 
5-1. 
 
     
∫

dt f(t)   R(t)  (Equation 5-1) 
 
a. Exponential distribution.  If the underlying failure distribution is exponential, a common, but only 
approximate, assumption for mechanical and electrical systems, equation 5-1 becomes equation 5-2.  If 
the underlying distribution for each element is exponential and the failure rates, λi, for each element are 
known, then the reliability of the system can be calculated using equation 5-2.   
 
    t-e  R(t) λ=  (Equation 5-2) 
 
where: 
 
 λ is the failure rate  
 t is the length of time the system must function 
 e is the base of natural logarithms 
 R(t) is reliability over time t

b. Series reliability.  Consider the system represented by the reliability block diagram (RBD) in figure 
5-1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5-1.  Reliability block diagram. 
 
(1) Series configuration - the weakest link. A and B in figure 5-1 are said to be in series, which 
means all must operate for the system to operate.  Since the system can be no more reliable than the 
least reliable component, this configuration is often referred to as the weakest link configuration.  An 
analogy would be a chain; the strength of the chain is determined by its weakest link. 
 
(2) Series calculation method 1.  Since the components are in series, the system reliability can be 
found by adding together the failure rates of the components and substituting the result in equation 5-2.  
The system failure rate is 0.001000 + 0.001500 = 0.002500.  The reliability is: 
 
     
9753.0e)t(R 10x0025.0 == −  (Equation 5-3) 
 
(3) Series calculation method 2.  Alternatively, we could find the system reliability by multiplying 
the reliabilities of the two components as follows:  0.9900 x 0.9851 = 0.9753.   
 
c. Reliability with Redundancy.  Now consider the RBD shown in figure 5-2.

Figure 5-2.  RBD of a system with redundant components. 
 
      (1) The redundant or parallel configuration.  The system represented by the RBD in figure 5-2 has 
the same components (A and B) used in figure 5-1, but two of each component are used in a configuration 
referred to as redundant or parallel.  Two paths of operation are possible.  The paths are top A-B and bot-
tom A-B.  If either of two paths is intact, the system can operate.  The reliability of the system is most 
easily calculated by finding the probability of failure (1 - R (t)) for each path, multiplying the probabilities 
of failure (which gives the probability of both paths failing), and then subtracting the result from 1.  The 
reliability of each path was found in the previous example.  Next, the probability of a path failing is found 
by subtracting its reliability from 1.  Thus, the probability of either path failing is 1 - 0.9753 = 0.0247.  
The probability that both paths will fail is 0.0247 x 0.0247 = 0.0006.  Finally, the reliability of the system 
is 1 - 0.0006 = 0.9994, about a 2.5% improvement over the series-configured system. 
 
      (2) Types of redundancy.  Two components in parallel (redundant) may always be on and in opera-
tion (hot standby) or one may be off or not in the "circuit" (cold standby).  In the latter case, failure of the 
primary component must be sensed and the standby component turned on or switched into the circuit.  
Standby redundancy may be necessary to avoid interference between the redundant components and, if 
the redundant component is normally off, reduces the time over which the redundant component will be 
used (it's only used from the time when the primary component fails to the end of the mission).  Of 
course, more than two components can be in parallel. Both types of standby redundancy are available in 
PLC systems

5-3. Redundancy terminology 
 
Redundant configurations of systems and equipment are commonly referred to using mathematical formu-
las based on the parameter “N”, such as “N + 1” or “2N”.  In this convention, N is the number of systems 
or pieces of equipment which must be operational to meet the load or accomplish the mission. 
 
a. N + X redundancy refers to a system configuration in which the total number of units provided is 
equal to the number needed to meet the load, N, plus some number of spare units, X.  For example, if a 
cooling system requires 300 gallons per minute (gpm) of flow, and five 100 gpm pumps are provided, the 
system would be described as N + 2, where N = 3. 
 
b. XN redundancy refers to a system configuration in which the total number of units provided is 
some multiple, X, of the number required to meet the load.  For example, if the same cooling system were 
provided with two 300 gpm pumps, it would be described as 2N, where N = 1. 
 
Further information on redundant system configurations can be obtained from TM 5-698-1 – Reliabil-
ity/Availability of Electrical and Mechanical Systems for Command, Control, Computer, Communica-
tions, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Facilities. 
 
5-4. Availability calculations 
 
a. Once an expected failure rate, λ, is known for a component or a system, the associated availability 
can be calculated from the failure rate and the repair time, r as in equation 5-4. 
 
8760
8760 rA λ−=  (Equation 5-4) 
 
  λ = failure rate, per year 
  r = repair time, hours 
 
b. Availability can also be calculated from published or tested Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) 
and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) data using equation 5-5: 
 
Ai %100×+= MTTRMTBF
MTBF  (Equation 5-5) 
 
Availability calculated on this basis is also termed inherent availability, Ai, as it is based only on the in-
herent failure characteristics of the system and does not account for unavailability for scheduled mainte-
nance or overhauls.  Operational availability, Ao, is availability calculated including the effects of sched-
uled downtime based on Mean Time Between Maintenance (MTBM) and Mean Down Time (MDT) as 
shown in Equation 5-6.  As SCADA systems and components rarely require extended shutdowns for 
maintenance, inherent availability is an appropriate design and performance criteria.

5-5. Component reliability 
 
The components used to assemble SCADA systems are typically industrial- or utility-grade sensors, con-
trollers, relays and actuators, which are mass-produced in large numbers for the commercial market and 
generally are not designed to Military Specifications (MilSpec) or to documented reliability criteria. 
Where available, SCADA systems should use components meeting the applicable MilSpec designations. 
For those applications where such components are not available, components should comply with other 
applicable industry standards that address reliability, maintainability, environmental protection, seismic 
withstand, surge withstand, etc.  
 
a. Reliability of non-Milspec components should be enhanced by specifying heavy-duty components 
or overrating of devices, where such overrating does not interfere with the operation or function of the 
component. Examples include: 
 
          (1)  Use of 600V rated wire for all control circuits operating above 50 V. 
 
          (2)  Use of relays with contact ratings exceeding circuit voltage and current ratings in 
power circuits. 
 
          (3)  Derating of devices to operate below a specified fraction (often 80%) of their capabil-
ity. 
 
b. Reliability data for electrical components used in the power supply circuits for SCADA systems 
can be obtained from IEEE 493, also known as “The Gold Book” or from the PREP Equipment Reliabil-
ity Database. 
 
5-6. Systems reliability 
 
Reliability of a SCADA system can be calculated from the known indices of the components or subsys-
tems as described above. From a qualitative standpoint, however, there are two primary considerations in 
developing a reliable SCADA system: Providing segregation and redundancy corresponding to that speci-
fied for the supported mechanical and electrical systems; and keeping the configuration, control se-
quences, and programming as simple as is consistent with the required functionality.  The tendency to 
design control sequences to account on an automatic basis for every conceivable contingency or to pro-
vide sustained service to the load after the third or fourth contingency failure often results in systems that 
are unwieldy to operate and makes it difficult for operators to retain knowledge of the system. Because of 
the critical role of humans in the function of SCADA systems (see chapter 6), complex configurations and 
sequences that provide very high calculated reliability/availability indices may actually produce signifi-
cantly lower real-world availability than simpler systems due to the effects of human action.  
 
a. It is said that software neither fails randomly nor wears out, a nd thus all software failures must be 
designed into the system, and simply remain dormant  until the right combination of input conditions, tim-
ing and logic cause them to show up.  SCADA soft ware should incorporate self-diagnostic features in-
cluding flow control, watchdog timers, and reasona bleness checking.  Failure of a self-diagnostic check 
should result in an alarm report to the supervisory syst em, driving all outputs to a defined fail-safe state, 
and transfer of control to the redundant processor, where provided.  Comprehensive commissioning test-
ing, as described in chapter 8, can significantly reduce the likelihood of undiscovered software errors.  
 
b. System reliability can be enhanced by anticipating likely field device failure modes and providing 
program logic to detect them.  For example, monitoring the position of a critical circuit breaker using only 

TM 5-601 
 
5-6 
a single normally open or normally closed auxiliary c ontact leaves the control system vulnerable to false 
information in the event of a short or open on the input  circuit.  If both contacts are used, they must al-
ways agree on the state of the breaker, or a faulted input circuit is declared and automatic operation of that 
breaker suspended.   
 
5-7. Power supply sources 
 
The preferred power supply for SCADA systems is the direct current (DC) station battery system supply-
ing the equipment controlled by the SCADA.  DC Station battery systems can be inherently more reliable 
than alternating current (AC) uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems, because they rely on electronic 
components only to maintain the batteries in a charged state, and not to deliver energy to the load. PLCs 
are available with DC power supplies rated at voltages between 24 VDC and 125 VDC, and DC-DC con-
verters are available to supply lower voltage components from higher voltage systems. 
  
a. Station battery banks provide voltage over a range limited on the lower end by the specified end-of-
discharge voltage, which is typically 1.75 volts per cell (VPC) for lead-acid batteries and 1.14 VPC for 
nickel cadmium batteries and on the upper end by charging voltage required to periodically equalize the 
batteries, typically 2.38 VPC for lead-acid and 1.70 VPC for nickel cadmium. SCADA components must 
be rated to operate properly over this range, or must be provided with DC-DC converters that are rated for 
this input range.  
 
b. The level of redundancy in power supply circuits should correspond to the redundancy criteria of 
the PLC.  For example, in multiple generator paralleling switchgear applications where reliability is at-
tained through an N+X generator configuration, it is common for each generator to be provided with a 
single PLC supplied from the DC control voltage source of that generator, which is typically the starting 
battery.  A redundant power circuit to the generator PLC would add no benefit as the generator cannot 
start without local control power anyway.  The master controller associated with the paralleling switch-
gear, however, is typically a redundant PLC configuration.  It should be provided with redundant DC sup-
plies from separate station battery banks.  
 
c. Diode-based “best battery” selection systems, as shown in figure 5-3 may be used to increase sys-
tem availability by supplying non-redundant pieces of switchgear or SCADA system equipment from two 
or more DC power sources.  This arrangement provides automatic protection against low voltage or com-
plete loss of one source, as the diode pair with the highest voltage is always conducting and the “failed” 
source is isolated from the load by the other diode pair that is in a reverse-biased blocking state.  This 
source selection scheme must only be used at the branch circuit level, as it does not provide isolation of 
the sources for short circuits on the load side of the diodes.  Such a short circuit will cause both diodes to 
conduct, clearing the fuses or tripping the circuit breakers on both DC circuits.  For this reason, individual 
sets of diodes should be provided for each PLC cabinet, circuit breaker, etc. to limit the outage to the af-
fected unit. 
 
 

TM 5-601 
 
 
5-7 
 
 
 
Figure 5-3.  Diode-based “best-battery” selector circuit 
 
d. Every branch of a control power circuit should be provided with a voltage relay or other means of 
supervision to verify continuously the presence of control power.  This supervision should be provided on 
the load side of all fuses, circuit breakers, diodes and transfer switches.  Failure of any control power 
branch circuit should initiate local and central alarms. 
  
e. Where UPS systems must be used to supply SCADA equipment that requires AC power, they 
should be of the on-line, or reverse transfer type, in which the rectifier-inverter combination is normally 
supplying the load while float-charging the battery and provided with quarter-cycle static switching to the 
AC line upon inverter failure. UPS systems should be selected in compliance with TM 5-693, Uninterrup-
tible Power Supply System Selection, Installation, and Maintenance for Command, Control, Communica-
tions, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Facilities.  

TM 5-601 
 
5-8 
 
f. SCADA power supplies must be provided with overcurrent protective devices (fuses or circuit 
breakers) whose ratings and settings have been determined to provide selectively coordinated protection.  
Selective coordination is defined as opening the protective device closest to the point of the fault without 
opening upstream devices, thus limiting the associated outage to the faulted circuit or equipment.  Guide-
lines for selective coordination can be found in IEEE 242 – Protection and Coordination of Industrial 
Power Systems. 
 
5-8. Segregation 
 
Redundant components and subsystems should be segregated electrically and physically to reduce the 
probability of common mode failure from electrical, environmental, or physical threats.   
 

TM 5-601

CHAPTER 6 
OPERATOR INTERFACES 
 
6-1. General interfaces 
 
Operator interfaces, or human machine interface (HMI) for SCADA systems provide the functions of 
status indication, alarm reporting, operator intervention in control action, and data storage and program-
ming.  Several levels or layers of operator interfaces are required to provide a reliable and maintainable 
system: equipment level, controller level, and supervisory level. At the controller and supervisory level, 
HMI may also provide capability to modify the controller program. 
 
6-2. Equipment level  
 
Equipment level HMI should consist at minimum of the control switches and indicators necessary to per-
mit an operator to manually control the equipment in the absence of communications from the controller 
or for maintenance purposes. Examples of this level of control are hand-auto-off switches and indicator 
lights at motor starters; local-remote switches, potentiometers and meters at variable frequency drives; 
and circuit breaker control switches, meters and indicator lights at switchgear. Table 6-1 lists minimum 
manual control capabilities to be provided for mechanical and electrical system components:

a. Manual control substitutes the facility operator for the automatic control system in the feedback 
loop, and leads to the risk of system or equipment mis-operation due to human error. Safety interlocks, 
such as motor overload, high-high pressure switches, fire detection, etc. should therefore be hard-wired 
into the control circuit such that they are active in both manual and automatic control modes. Switchgear 
protective relaying required for fault protection should always be hard-wired in the circuit breaker trip 
circuit and not dependent upon the controller. 
 
b. In some cases, hard-wired manual controls for entire facilities have been centrally located in a con-
trol panel or benchboard at the control room. Although this simplifies operator intervention upon com-
plete failure of the automatic control system, it is not recommended as the lack of physical segregation 
compromises reliability. A catastrophic structural or environmental failure at the control room would dis-
able both automatic and manual control capability. 
 
6-3. Controller level HMI 
 
At the controller level, the primary HMI device should be a graphical display/keypad combination provid-
ing access to input and output data, timer and register settings, and alarm and status screens. These de-
vices are commonly panel-mounted in the door of the PLC cabinet, and are available in enclosures suit-
able for hostile environments. With password-protected access control the controller level HMI may also 
provide a means of accessing and modifying the controller program logic. Table 6-2 lists the minimum 
recommended functionality of controller level HMI.

(1) Increasing numbers indicate more restricted levels of operator access.  Access levels are 
typically password-protected.  Each access level includes the functionality of those below 
it. 
 
6-4. Supervisory level HMI 
 
Supervisory level HMI devices are typically personal computer workstations located in the central control 
room and/or management and engineering offices. The quantity and function of these workstations de-
pends on the size and complexity of the facility. Simple facilities may be provided with a single work-
station, which may be located in the main electrical or mechanical space in the absence of a central con-
trol room. Large or complex facilities should be provided with a minimum of two workstations in the 

TM 5-601 
 
6-3 
control room to permit operators to back one another up, plus the additional workstations required for en-
gineering use, management overview, or data storage and reporting, as determined by the facility man-
ager. Multiple-building campuses should be provided with workstations in the mechanical/electrical space 
of each major building to permit operations staff to obtain status and alarm information for the entire fa-
cility from any building. 
 
a. Supervisory level HMI uses graphical screens displayed on the computer monitor to communicate 
system status and alarm conditions. Screens should be configured for facility overview, system overview, 
subsystem, and equipment screens for all major components of the facility.  Remote manual control and 
supervisory control is typically performed at the supervisory level HMI under security access control.  
(See 7-3.) 
 
b. Trending and data storage capability should be included in all SCADA systems to provide a perma-
nent log of facility performance.  All critical system parameters, such as temperature, humidity, voltage, 
current, should be stored every 15 minutes (or other specified preset time interval).  The system should 
have the capability to record critical signal values more frequently at an operator-selected rate when 
prompted from the HMI or by a signal from operating equipment.  The system should automatically re-
turn to its primary trending when system operation returns to normal. Data storage should utilize a sepa-
rate server or drive from that used for the primary system control software and should be periodically 
backed up. Records should be maintained on-site for a minimum of 5 years.  
 
6-5. Human factors 
 
Design of HMI for SCADA systems must include consideration of Human Factors Engineering (HFE). It 
is estimated that 50 percent or more of all loss of load events in mission-critical facilities involve human 
action. A commonly reported scenario begins with a single component failure and correct response by the 
automatic control system to isolate the failure and maintain service to the load, however resulting in an 
off-normal system condition. Incorrect human intervention in attempting to restore the system to normal 
conditions then results in loss of service to the load. Consideration of HFE in the layout of operator con-
trols can help prevent these occurrences. 
 
a. Labeling: All control devices must be clearly labeled with letters that are large enough and provide 
high contrast with the background to be clearly legible in a hurry at a full arms length. The primary desig-
nation should be the functional description of the device, ex: “Generator No. 1 Speed Control”. The label 
should also carry the tag number of the device, ex: “43GS-1” that corresponds to the system documenta-
tion, but this information is secondary in emphasis and size to the primary designation. 
 
b. Layout: Controls should be arranged and grouped in an intuitive and logical manner. Some of the 
many techniques that may be used to design intuitive layouts include: 
 
           (1)  Grouping controls associated with individual pieces of equipment such as a chiller or a genera-
tor with substantial separation between groups. 
 
           (2)  Placing control switches left-to-right, or top-to-bottom in the sequential order in which they 
are operated during a normal startup or shutdown. 
 
           (3)  Spacing devices far enough apart so that labels are clearly associated with their device and an 
operator’s hand does not obscure the labels on adjacent devices.   
 
           (4)  Arranging controls in the physical or electrical order of the process, using a mimic diagram or 
mimic bus. 

TM 5-601 
6-4 
(5)  Color-coding control devices by function; ex: green start buttons, red stop buttons, yellow 
lamp test buttons, etc. 
            
(6) Colored backgrounds or borders to emphasize grouping of controls on large control panels.  
 
c. Color schemes: Color schemes used for controls and for graphic screens may duplicate color coding 
used within the process, such as piping color codes or system color codes, or may be developed strictly 
for the HMI. In all cases, colors should be selected to provide high levels of contrast without eye fatigue.  
Some rules for use of color in HMI displays are given in table 6-3. 
 
Table 6-3.  Rules for HMI colors schemes 
 
Use colors with gray scale contrast ratios of approximately 3:7. 
Use neutral background colors, such as light gray. 
Limit the number of colors to seven, unless more are required, as for trend 
graphs. 
Sixteen colors are sufficient for 95 percent of all applications. 
Use the standard Windows® interface colors listed in table 6-4. 
Observe industry standard color conventions; red for breaker closed, green 
for breaker open, etc. 
Use color consistently between screens. 
 
d. Select-before-operate: HMI software should be programmed such that an operator must select the 
device to be controlled by point-and-click or other means and then select the operation to be performed.  
This two-step requirement for manual control can reduce errors resulting from selection of the incorrect 
device.  Selection of a device to be controlled should result in highlighting that device on the screen, pro-
viding the operator a visual verification of correct selection.

CHAPTER 7 
SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS 
 
7-1. Environmental threats 
 
SCADA equipment installed in C4ISR facilities must be of such design or otherwise protected to with-
stand seismic effects as well as shock (ground motion) and overpressure effects of weapons.  A detailed 
dynamic analysis should be made of the supporting structure(s) of the equipment enclosures to evaluate 
the magnitude of motion and acceleration established at the mounting points for each piece of SCADA 
equipment.  Where accelerations exceed the allowable limits of equipment available, the equipment 
should be mounted on shock isolation platforms. 
 
a. SCADA equipment should be protected from the effects of dust, dirt, water, corrosive agents, other 
fluids and contamination by appropriate location within the facility or by specifying enclosures appropri-
ate for the environment.  Care should be taken that installation methods and conduit and tubing penetra-
tions do not compromise enclosure integrity.  
 
b. Central computer or control rooms should be provided with dry agent fire protection systems or 
double-interlocked pre-action sprinkler systems using cross-zoned detection, to minimize the threat of 
accidental water discharge onto unprotected equipment.   
 
c. Sensors, actuators, controllers, HMI, UPS and other SCADA equipment located throughout the fa-
cility should utilize enclosures with a minimum environmental protection level of IP66 per EN 60529 or 
Type 4 per NEMA 250.  Where thermal management issues or other equipment requirements prevent use 
of such enclosures, alternate means should be provided to protect the equipment from environmental con-
taminants. 
 
d. Facility design must ensure that any facility chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or explosive 
(CBRNE) protection warning, alert, or protection systems also protect SCADA systems and utility equip-
ment areas if the mission requires the facility to remain operational in a CBRNE environment.  Appropri-
ate coordination and systems integration must occur between SCADA and CBRNE protection systems so 
that appropriate facility environmental conditions are maintained if the facility experiences a CBRNE at-
tack or incident. 
 
7-2. Electronic threats 
 
Electronic threats to SCADA systems include voltage transients, radio-frequency (RF) interference (RFI), 
RF weapons, ground potential difference and electromagnetic pulse (EMP).  These threats can all be 
largely mitigated by proper design of the systems 
 
a. SCADA controllers and field devices are vulnerable to voltage transients coupled through the facil-
ity power system from atmospheric (thunderstorm and lightning) effects, transmission and distribution 
system switching events, and switching of capacitors or inductive loads within the facility.  Transient 
voltage surge suppression (TVSS) should be provided on the power supply circuits to all SCADA equip-
ment and TVSS or optical isolation should be provided on all metallic control and communication circuits 
transiting between buildings.  To avoid the effects of voltage transients, fiber optic cable should be used 
for all circuits entering or leaving a facility.  Fiber media are available for most network applications at 
the supervisory and control levels (see paragraph 4-1).  Field devices typically require metallic conduc-

TM 5-601 
7-2 
tors, and where these must be run outside or between facilities, they should be provided with TVSS where 
they cross the facility perimeter. 
 
(1) TVSS should be specified to comply with the testing requirements of ANSI C62.34 and should 
be installed in accordance with IEEE 1100.  Selection of TVSS locations and connections should consider 
that it is most effective when connected directly to the terminals of the device to be protected and pro-
vided with a direct low-impedance path to the facility ground system.  Incorrect installation methods can 
readily render TVSS protection ineffective.  Protected and unprotected circuits should be physically seg-
regated to avoid capacitive and inductive coupling that may bypass the TVSS.  See figure 7-1 for an ex-
ample of correct TVSS installation. 
 
(2) Network surge protectors should be provided at all device connections, between the equipment 
port and the tap.

b. C4ISR facilities often contain powerful radio frequency sources which may interfere with control 
system operation if coupled into control circuits.  Other ambient sources of RFI may also exist including 
commercial signals, electronic counter measures (ECM), and radiated RFI from other equipment within 
the facility.  Design and operation of SCADA systems should address measures to protect against RFI, 
including: 
 
(1) Use of shielded twisted pair or twisted triple conductors for low-level signals. 
 
(2) Installation of SCADA wiring in continuous metallic conduit systems. 
 

TM 5-601 
 
7-3 
(3) Use of metallic controller enclosures with RFI-gasketed doors. 
 
(4) RFI-shielded control rooms and computer rooms.  
 
(5) Maintenance practices that maintain the integrity of enclosures. 
 
c. Effective shielding to limit RFI to within the required limits for C4ISR facilities is dependent upon 
the grounding and bonding practices required to provide a unified facility ground.  The grounding prac-
tices for the earth electrode system, the building structure, the lightning protection system, the power sys-
tem, and the signal reference system must be integrated to achieve a unified ground system.  The particu-
lar grounding practices for each of these subsystems are illustrated in MIL-HDBK-419A, Grounding, 
Bonding, and Shielding for Electronic Equipment and Facilities.  Additionally, specifications and installa-
tion designs for new equipment should include requirements to assure electromagnetic compatibility 
(EMC) between the equipment and the operating environment.  These requirements should serve to mini-
mize the susceptibility of the new equipment to EMI that may be present in the operating environment as 
well as to limit radiated emissions by the equipment to the environment and to existing equipment. 
 
(1) Ground potential differences within a facility that may affect SCADA systems are mitigated by 
proper connection of equipment to the unified grounding system that is required to be provided for all 
C4ISR facilities.  This system ties the electrical service, lightning protection, and all other facility grounds 
together into a single low-impedance ground grid.  Additional grounding requirements for C4ISR facili-
ties may be found in TM 5-690, Grounding and Bonding in C4ISR facilities. 
 
(2) Each electrical room within the C4ISR facility which contains electrical equipment should be 
provided with a ground bus, connected to the unified ground system.  SCADA equipment enclosures and 
internal ground buses should be connected directly to this ground bus, and should not rely solely on an 
equipment grounding conductor installed with the power supply circuit. 
 
(3) All exterior metallic components which penetrate the building, such as metal piping, conduits, 
and ducts, should be grounded at the point of penetration.  All conductive SCADA circuits entering the 
facility from outside should be provided with TVSS, effectively grounded to the ground grid at the point 
of entry.  
 
(4) Low-voltage shielded cables must be installed to avoid ground loops, which can induce interfer-
ing currents on the signal common conductor.  Unless otherwise dictated by the equipment manufacturer, 
cable shields should be grounded at the controller end only, with the instrument end left floating and insu-
lated.  
 
(5) On large multi-facility sites potential differences between the different facilities’ ground sys-
tems caused by atmospheric electrical activity and electrical system faults can not be prevented, in spite 
of their common connection through the facility primary electrical distribution grounding system.  
SCADA circuits installed between facilities on these sites should always utilize fiber optic cables or opti-
cal signal isolation at the facility perimeter.   
 
d. EMP protection requires magnetically continuous ferrous shielding which is not provided by the 
enclosures of typical SCADA sensors, controllers and actuators.  For this reason, all electronic SCADA 
components must be assumed vulnerable to EMP and must be protected by location, external shielding, or 
replacement with pneumatic components. 
 
(1) Whenever possible, all SCADA components should be located inside the C4ISR HEMP shield.  
Components that must be located outside the shield, such as sensors at an external fuel storage tank, may 

TM 5-601 
7-4 
be provided with a local HEMP-shielded enclosure and circuits routed back to the facility within a 
shielded conduit system or using pneumatic lines or optical fiber cable.     
 
(2) EMP protection for non-conductive penetrations of the facility shield such as pneumatic tubing 
and fiber optic bundles uses the principle of “waveguide below cutoff” in which the lines penetrate the 
facility shield through a high aspect-ratio cylinder or waveguide.  The waveguide must be made of a con-
ductive material and must be continuously welded or soldered to the primary EMP shield so that current 
flowing on the waveguide can be discharged to the primary EMP shield.   
 
(3) The maximum inside diameter of a penetration must be 4 inches or less to achieve a cutoff fre-
quency of 1.47 GHz for a rectangular penetration and 1.73 GHz for a cylindrical penetration.  The unbro-
ken length of conducting material adjacent to the penetration must be a minimum of five times the diame-
ter of the conducting material (i.e., pipe, duct) to attenuate by at least 100 dB at the required frequencies.   
 
(4) The wave guide filter will be specified in terms of the attenuation over a specified range of fre-
quencies in accordance with TM 5-858-5, Designing Facilities to Resist Nuclear Weapons Effects: Air 
Entrainment, Fasteners, Penetration Protection, Hydraulic Surge Protection Devices, and EMP Protective 
Devices. 
 
e. Equipment located in electrical substations or other areas where electrical systems over 600V exist 
may be subject to particularly harsh transient voltage and transient electrical field conditions associated 
with power system faults, lightning strikes, and switching surges.  This equipment should be qualified to 
the industry standards applicable to the withstand capability of protective relays, ANSI C37.90.1, 
C37.90.2 and C37.90.3, which apply to surge voltage, radiated EMI and ESD, respectively.  Testing has 
shown that both STP and coaxial network communications circuits are subject to communications errors 
in high transient electric field conditions.  For this reason, all network communication within the substa-
tion environment should be over fiber optic circuits.  Even with a fiber communication circuit, the net-
work equipment connected to the fiber may be susceptible to radiated fields or to conducted interference 
at the power supply.  This equipment should be qualified to IEEE 1613, which requires automatic recov-
ery from transient-induced communications disruptions with no false operation and no human interven-
tion. 
 
f. Portable RF weapons of van size down to brief-case size are now commercially available.  Many of 
the above factors will also provide varying levels of protection against this emerging threat.  For example, 
a HEMP shield should provide protections from RF Weapons external to the shield.  However, it will 
provide no protection from an RF Weapon inside the shield.  Thus, a critical aspect of protection from this 
threat is ensuring physical security protection plans, measures, and procedures recognize this threat and 
mitigate it.  Examples of this are to insure that facility guards or security personnel are trained on this 
threat, are able to recognize RF Weapons, and that procedures are instituted for random or mandatory 
checks of all items entering the facility. 
 
7-3. Physical security 
 
In general, SCADA system equipment should be locat ed inside secured areas having the same degree of 
security deemed appropriate for the supported systems.   However, the electronic nature of these systems 
provides opportunities for compromise from both inside and outside the secured area that must be ad-
dressed. 
 
a. HMI devices for controllers that provide access to the entire SCADA system shall use password-
protected screen access with multiple levels of access control, and automatic logout routines with short 

TM 5-601 
 
7-5 
time settings.  Password policies for screen savers sha ll be in compliance with established DoD policies 
(CJCSI 6510.01D). 
 
b. Equipment enclosures and pull and junction boxes s hould be kept locked or secured with tamper-
resistant hardware.  Doors and covers should be provi ded with tamper switches or other means of detect-
ing attempted intrusion, connected to the site security system.  Tamper detection devices should be de-
signed to detect the initial stages of access such as removal of fasteners, unlatching of doors, etc. 
 
c. Raceways and enclosures for SCADA circuits external to the secured area should be designed to re-
sist entry by unauthorized persons.  Access to fi eld wiring circuit conductors can potentially provide 
“back-door” entry to controllers for damaging over-volta ges or transients.  Outside raceways should con-
sist of rigid steel conduits with threaded and welded joints and cast junction boxes with threaded hubs and 
tamper proof covers. 
 
d. Conduits exiting the secured area should also be sea led to prevent them from being used to intro-
duce hazardous or damaging gases or fluids into enclosures within the secured area. 
 
7-4. Communication and information networks 
 
Connections from SCADA systems to networks extending beyond the C4ISR facility or between facilities 
on a common site introduce the threat of attacks. 
 
a. These attacks are of several types: 
 
(1) Unauthorized user access (hacking). 
 
(2) Eavesdropping; recording of transmitted data. 
 
(3) Data interception, alteration, re-transmission. 
 
(4) Replay of intercepted and recorded data. 
 
(5) Denial of Service; flooding the network with traffic. 
 
b. The best defense against these threats is to entirely avoid network connections with other networks 
within or external to the facility.  If they must be used, data encryption techniques should be applied to all 
network traffic.  The following additional means of enhancing security should also be considered: 
 
(1) Physically disconnect when not in use; applicable to dial-up connections for vendor service. 
 
         (2)  Use fiber optic media which cannot be tapped or intercepted without loss of signal at the receiv-
ing end. 
 
  (3)  One-way traffic; alarm and status transmission only with no control permitted. 
 
7-5.  Software management and documentation 
 
With the modern complexity and exposure to intentional software damage that can occur in modern in-
dustrial controls systems, it is a good practice to implement a Software Management and Documentation 
System (SMDS).   
 

TM 5-601 
7-6 
     a.  A SMDS system is software which resides on a dedicated computer on the plant network that moni-
tors all activities of the control system.  Such a system should be required for the control system in an im-
portant and complex military facility.  It allows the facility administrator to do the following: 
 
(1) Control who may use any SCADA application software and what actions can be performed 
 
(2) Maintain a system-wide repository for historical storage of the application configuration files 
 
(3) Identify exactly who has modified a control system configuration or application parameter, 
what they changed, where they changed it from, and when the change was made 
 
(4) Assure that the control system configuration thought to be running the facility actually is 
 
(5) Support application restoration following a catastrophic event 
 
(6) Generate views into the Software Management System for more detailed analysis of configura-
tion changes 
 
    b.  Software Management and Documentation systems are available now from the major suppliers of 
industrial control systems.  Having such a system provides the following additional benefits: 
 
(1) Avoids maintaining incorrect or incompatible software versions 
 
(2) Assures that there are not multiple versions of software on file 
 
(3) Prevents multiple users from causing a conflict somewhere on the system 
 
(4) Prevents legitimate changes from being reversed or overwritten 
 
(5) Supports the availability of the system at its maximum 
 
    c.  Among the specific software that such a system would secure are: 
 
(1) PLC programs 
 
(2) HMI screens 
 
(3) SCADA configurations 
 
(4) CAD drawings 
 
(5) Standard Operating Procedures (SOP’s) 
 
(6) Network Configurations

CHAPTER 8 
COMMISSIONING/VALIDATION 
 
8-1. General commissioning 
 
Commissioning is the formal process of verifying and documenting that the installed SCADA system 
complies with and performs in accordance with the design intent, as defined in the design documentation 
described in chapter 10.  Commissioning should be identified as a specific activity requiring its own plan-
ning, scheduling, management and monitoring during the design and construction process.  A commis-
sioning team should be assembled including representatives of all involved parties.   
 
a. Those represented should include as a minimum: 
 
(1) Government project management  
 
(2) Facility operations  
 
(3) Design engineer 
 
(4) General contractor 
 
(5) Mechanical subcontractor 
 
(6) Electrical subcontractor 
 
(7) System integrator 
 
(8) Installation subcontractor 
 
(9) Major equipment vendors 
 
(10) Reliability engineer 
   
b. Roles and responsibilities of the various parties within the commissioning process may vary with 
the agency and the type of project.  In some cases, an independent engineer may be brought in to coordi-
nate and oversee the commissioning process.  If an independent engineer is not used, the design engineer 
should be retained to oversee the commissioning process.  In either case, certain key components of the 
program that must be included for a successful outcome: 
 
(1) A clear definition of the process and the parties’ roles and responsibilities (Commissioning 
Plan). 
 
(2) Integration of commissioning activities into the overall project schedule. 
 
(3) An organized system of commissioning documentation. 
 
(4) Development of written testing and verification procedures for every critical aspect of system 
performance. 
 
(5) Review of these procedures by all affected parties prior to testing. 

TM 5-601 
8-2 
(6) Clear definition prior to testing of the criteria for acceptance. 
 
(7) Procedures for correction and retesting in the case of failure. 
 
c. Projects completed through the Military Construction (Mil Con) process automatically include 
commissioning.  Facility managers must assure that commissioning is included in the scope of site-
initiated projects. 
 
8-2. Factory acceptance testing 
 
A factory acceptance test and demonstration should be required in which the controller(s), I/O, and HMI 
hardware and software are verified to the extent possible without the actual field devices.   
 
a. This test should demonstrate the following: 
 
(1) Simulation of all inputs 
 
(2) Operation of all outputs with dummy load 
 
(3) Loop operation 
 
(4) Control sequences 
 
(5) Network communications 
 
(6) HMI screens, displays, and alarms 
 
(7) Operator control functions 
 
(8) Physical and information security measures 
 
b. PLC systems providing control of standby generators and paralleling switchgear should be factory-
tested with the switchgear to demonstrate actual operation of the breakers and other controls with simu-
lated utility and generator voltage and frequency sources. 
 
8-3. Integrity testing 
 
Pneumatic lines should be pressure tested per ISA RP 7.1 and checked for obstructions.  Electrical con-
ductors should be tested for continuity and insulation resistance according to industry standards for their 
voltage ratings. 
 
8-4. Calibration 
 
Instrument and actuator calibration should be completed prior to loop checkout or startup of systems.  The 
calibration program should include the following: 
 
a. All sensors, elements, indicators, transmitters and actuators should be calibrated from NIST-
traceable standards according to the manufacturer’s instructions.   
 
b. All calibration equipment should have current independent certification of accuracy.   
 

TM 5-601 
 
8-3 
c. Stroke actuators and verify control action, limits, and end switches.   
 
d. Each calibrated instrument should be field-marked with a waterproof calibration tag bearing the 
range, setpoint, date and calibrator’s initials. 
 
e. An Instrument Certification sheet should be comp leted for each instrument and included in the 
system documentation.  A detailed description is described in paragraph 8-9. 
 
f. A Final Control Element Certification sheet shoul d be completed for each control valve and in-
cluded in the system documentation.  A detailed description is described in paragraph 8-10. 
 
8-5. Loop verification  
 
The wiring of each control loop should be physically verified from the field device terminals to the con-
troller.  Cable, conductor, terminal board and terminal designations should be verified and marked off as 
such on a copy of the loop diagram or equivalent schematic or wiring diagram.  Verification should be by 
signal tracing, continuity verification, or “ringing out”.  Tags and labels placed during construction should 
not be considered adequate verification. 
  
 
a. Each control loop should be verified by injection of an appropriate pressure, voltage, or current sig-
nal.  Use actual signals where available. 
 
(1) Closely observe controllers, recorders, alarm and trip units, remote setpoints, ratio systems, and 
other control components.  Make corrections as require d.  Following any corrections, retest the loop as 
before. 
 
(2) Stroke all control valves, cylinders, drives a nd connecting linkages from the local control sta-
tion and from the control room operator interface. 
 
(3) Check all interlocks to the maximum extent po ssible.  In addition to any other as-recorded 
documents, record all setpoint and calibration changes on all system documentation. 
 
b. All analog loops should be tuned for optimum response using a closed-loop tuning method and the 
resulting gain, reset and rate recorded on the loop checkout sheet. 
 
c. A Control Loop Checkout sheet should be completed for each loop.  A detailed description is de-
scribed in paragraph 8-11. 
 
8-6. Functional performance testing 
 
Performance testing of all systems should be performed to verify compliance with the specified sequences 
of operations and control diagrams.  Functional performance testing consists of executing written step-by-
step procedures in which a condition is initiated or simulated and the response of the system is noted and 
compared to the specified response.  Functional performance tests must verify the following: 
 
a. Manual and automatic control modes. 
 
b. Normal system conditions and modes of operation. 
 
c. Contingency conditions and modes of operation. 

TM 5-601 
8-4 
 
d. Effect of all operator controls. 
 
e. Operation of all interlocks and permissives. 
 
f. Confirmation of failure state of all outputs. 
 
g. Physical and information security measures. 
 
8-7. Software integrity 
 
It is common for PLC programming errors to be identified during functional performance testing of 
SCADA systems.  Typically these are easily corrected by revising the program logic via a laptop com-
puter and testing is then continued.  It is also common for unforeseen circumstances to dictate that a 
change be made to the specified sequence of operation in the field, again easily implemented by changing 
the PLC logic.  These common startup processes contain the serious risk that a change made to correct 
misoperation at one point in the PLC control sequence may inadvertently affect the performance of other 
control sequences that have already been tested and accepted.  
 
8-8. Re-commissioning 
 
Whenever all or part of a SCADA system is modified, repaired or replaced, re-commissioning is required 
to verify that the portions of the system affected function correctly and that the work has not affected 
other portions of the system.  The extent of re-commissioning required should be determined from the 
extent of the modifications. 
 
a. For work that affects only devices and wiring external to the controller, the affected loops should be 
verified and functionally tested. 
 
b. For changes to controller program logic or settings, the entire process or subsystem supported by 
that controller should be functionally tested, and the interface to the supervisory level HMI verified. 
 
c. More extensive modifications may require re-commissioning of the complete SCADA system.    
 
d. Functional performance testing for system certification must take place without operator interven-
tion in the processor from beginning to end of the test.  For this reason it is highly recommended that a 
complete pre-test be conducted, using the full functional performance test procedure, prior to undertaking 
the certification test. 
 
8-9. Instrument certification sheet 
 
Prior to functional performance testing, all sensors and instruments should be calibrated and documented 
using an Instrument Certification Sheet.  Each Instrument Certification Sheet should include four sec-
tions: 
 
a. Description of the Instrument such as Tag Number and Description; 
 
b. A table to record the calibration of Transmitters and Indicators;  
 
c. A table to record the calibration of Process Switches; 
 

TM 5-601

8-10. Final control element certification sheet 
 
Valve actuators and other final control elements should also be calibrated and documented.  A final con-
trol element certification sheet should include four sections: 
 
a.  Description of the final control element such as tag number and description 
 
b.  A table to record the calibration of the I/P (current to pneumatic) converter, if applicable

CHAPTER 9 
MAINTENANCE PRACTICES 
 
9-1. General maintenance 
 
A comprehensive maintenance program is critical to attaining long-term reliable performance of SCADA 
systems. Periodic device calibration, preventive maintenance, and testing allow potential problems to be 
identified before they can cause mission failure. Prompt corrective maintenance assures reliability by 
minimizing downtime of redundant components.  
 
9-2. Preventive maintenance 
 
The SCADA system should be part of the overall preventive maintenance (PM) program for the facility. 
Table 9-1 provides a list of recommended maintenance activities and frequencies for SCADA systems 
and their components. Preventive maintenance schedules for SCADA components and subsystems should 
be coordinated with those for the mechanical/electrical systems they serve to minimize overall scheduled 
downtime.

a. Many components of SCADA systems, such as dead-bus relays, are not required to function under 
normal system operating modes. For this reason the system should be tested periodically under actual or 
simulated contingency conditions. These tests should approach as closely as possible the actual off-

TM 5-601 
9-2 
normal conditions in which the system must operate. For example, SCADA for standby generator plants 
should be tested by interrupting the utility source as far upstream of the normal service as possible. 
 
b. Periodic system testing procedures can duplicate or be derived from the functional performance 
testing procedures discussed in chapter 8. 
 
c. The SCADA software maintenance should include timely updates of any new versions from the 
supplier and testing to verify proper installation on the SCADA computer.  In addition, software anti-
virus updates should be maintained.  This should be performed any time after the computer is connected 
to the Internet.  Normal operation requires that the SCADA computer not be connected to the Internet. 
 
d. Electrical power systems, both AC and DC, serving SCADA systems should be maintained in ac-
cord with the requirements of TM 5-692-1 and NFPA 70B. 
 
9-3. Concurrent maintenance 
 
Concurrent maintenance is defined as testing, troubleshooting, repair or replacement of a component or 
subsystem while redundant component(s) or subsystem(s) are serving the load. The ability to perform 
concurrent maintenance is critical to attaining the specified reliability/availability criteria for C4ISR fa-
cilities and must be designed into the SCADA system.  Where SCADA components are associated with 
equipment that has redundancy and therefore are not themselves redundant, their maintenance should be 
scheduled to occur during maintenance of the associated equipment. SCADA components and controllers 
that are redundant must be capable of being taken out of service, repaired or replaced and tested without 
interfering with the operation of the redundant component. 
 
9-4. Reliability centered maintenance 
 
Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) is an approach for developing an effective and efficient mainte-
nance program based on the reliability characteristics of the constituent parts and subsystems, economics, 
and safety. RCM provides a logical, structured framework for determining the optimum mix of applicable 
and effective maintenance activities needed to sustain the operational reliability of systems and equipment 
while ensuring their safe and economical operation and support. RCM has changed the approach to pre-
ventive maintenance, and can be considered the “next step” in moving from a trial and error based ap-
proach to establishing PM frequencies to an intelligent approach to maintenance planning.  A significant 
byproduct of the application of SCADA systems to the control of C4ISR facilities is the large amount of 
operational data made available through the trending and data storage features of the SCADA. This opera-
tional data can be used for automated performance monitoring of mechanical and electrical systems that 
can support a RCM approach.  Detailed information about the application of RCM to C4ISR facilities can 
be found in Chapter 3 of TM 5-698-1, and in TM 5-698-2.    
 
9-5. Operations and maintenance documentation 
 
The design agency should perform an O&M analysis to determine the O&M data required to support 
maintenance of the SCADA system by the using government agency.  This analysis should be coordi-
nated with the using government agency to determine maintenance parameters and O&M data that are 
available to the using government agency.  Typical O&M data requirements include the following items: 
 
a. System documentation as defined in chapter 10. 
 
b. Minimum spare parts list. 
 

TM 5-601 
 
9-3 
c. Recommended spare parts list. 
 
d. Recommended onsite test equipment. 
 
e. Recommended O&M training. 
 
f. Recommended O&M to be performed by contract. 
 
9-6. Spare parts stocking 
 
An adequate on-site stock of spare parts is essential to obtaining high availability of SCADA systems. 
Reliability calculations demonstrating compliance with “six nines” criteria typically use repair times 
based on “replace with spare” which are shorter than those for “repair failed component”. If on-site stocks 
are inadequate, actual availabilities will be significantly less than these calculated values. 
 
a. Minimum recommended stocking levels include the following. These quantities may need to be in-
creased for components which are used in large numbers in the facility: 
 
(1) Manufacturer’s recommended spare parts list. 
 
(2) One each of all line replaceable boards or modules. 
 
(3) Six each power and control fuses used in the system. 
 
(4) Tools required to terminate coaxial on fiber optic cables. 
 
b. Specifications should also require that the following be furnished with each system: 
 
(1) Laptop computer loaded with software required to access controllers. 
 
(2) Licenses for all software installed on the system. 
 
(3) Permission to modify program code. 
 
(4) Spare cables for connecting computer to controllers. 
 
9-7. Technical support 
 
The design agency should specify functional areas of the operating system and/or equipment where a 
technical representative will be furnished by the manufacturer for training, test, checkout, validation, or 
pre-operational exercises.  Ongoing O&M of SCADA system software may require technical support 
from the system vendor or from agency technical personnel not located at the facility. Commercial 
SCADA software typically has provisions for remote modem access that permit this type of support from 
the vendor’s location or an agency central engineering group. Such remote access provisions represent a 
vulnerability to “hacking” and must be used with great caution. They should be monitored when in use 
and physically disconnected when not in use. PLC suppliers have indicated that they are unable to provide 
a firewall that will protect the controller program in the event of unauthorized access to the HMI proces-
sor.  Password protection policies for all SCADA systems, including PLC’s, shall be in compliance with 
established DoD policies.  The DoD policy is established by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
Instruction (CJCSI) 6510.01 D, Information Assurance (AI) and Computer Network Defense (CND).  

TM 5-601 
9-4 
These policies require that the default password that came from the control supplier be changed when 
placed into operation at the facility.

CHAPTER 10 
DOCUMENTATION AND CHANGE CONTROL 
 
10-1.  General 
 
Complete and accurate documentation is critical to the commissioning and ongoing maintenance and op-
eration of a SCADA system and should be a high priority of design contract administration.  
 
a. SCADA system documentation provided by the system designer and/or system integrator should 
include the following: 
 
(1) One-line diagrams  
 
(2) Process and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) 
 
(3) Sequences of operation 
 
(4) Instrument data sheets 
 
(5) Points list 
 
(6) Loop diagrams or I/O wiring diagrams

(11)   Software configuration management documentation 
 
(12)   Facility physical and information security policies 
 
b. All SCADA documentation should be furnished in both hard copy and appropriate electronic for-
mat. Electronic format should be capable of revision; i.e. scanned documents or portable document format 
(pdf) files are not acceptable, although pdfs may be submitted as archive copies in addition to revisable 
files. 
 
    c.  All system documentation for C4ISR facilities should be treated as sensitive and this applies to 
SCADA system diagrams and documentation as well. At a minimum, document security measures should 
include: 
 
(1) Marking all documents For Official Use Only (FOUO) 
 
(2) Controlling access to documents 
 
(3) Properly destroying outdated or unused documents 
 

TM 5-601 
10-2 
10-2.  Symbols and identification 
 
Individual control loops should be identified by loop number following the convention established by ISA 
S5.1.  Each instrument, actuator and control point should have a unique tag number incorporating the loop 
number and identification letters per table 1 of ISA S5.1.  All equipment and instruments should be con-
sistently identified by their complete tag number on all drawings and points lists. 
 
10-3.  Process and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) 
 
P&IDs should be provided for all mechanical systems. P&IDs should depict all components of mechani-
cal systems including vessels, pumps, compressors, chillers, heat exchangers, piping, valves and instru-
ments and the control relationships between them. Symbols used should comply with ISA S5.1 - Instru-
mentation Symbols and Identification and ISA 5.3 - Graphic Symbols for Distributed Control/Shared 
Display Instrumentation, Logic and Computer Systems. 
 
10-4.  Sequences of operation 
 
Written sequences of operation should be provided for all control loops.  
 
a. Sequences of operation should include the following minimum information: 
 
(1) Manual and automatic control modes; 
 
(2) Normal system conditions and modes of operation; 
 
(3) Contingency conditions and modes of operation; 
 
(4) Effect of all operator controls; 
 
(5) Description of all interlocks and permissives; 
 
(6) Identification of failure state of all outputs. 
 
10-5.  Instrument data sheets 
 
Instrument data sheets should be provided per ISA S20 
 
10-6.  Points list 
 
A points list should be provided that includes all real and virtual input, output and control points.  
 
a. Provide the following information, where applicable, for each point: 
 
(1) System 
 
(2) Equipment 
 
(3) Loop number 
 
(4) Tag number 
 

TM 5-601 
 
10-3 
(5) Controller, rack and slot  
 
(6) Point type 
 
(7) Field location 
 
(8) Range 
 
(9) Failure state 
 
b. A points list is located in appendix D.  
 
10-7.  Loop diagrams 
 
Loop diagrams define the physical wiring for each loop from each instrument or actuator to the controller. 
All field devices, terminal boards, junction boxes, etc. are depicted along with the signal type and range. 
These drawings are the basis for verification of all SCADA system field wiring, instrument calibration, 
and loop tuning. All devices, terminals, cables and conductors must be completely identified on the loop 
diagrams per ISA S5.4 – Instrument Loop Diagrams. A loop diagram is located on page D-2. 
 
10-8.  Binary logic diagrams 
 
Binary logic diagrams are flowcharts that depict all discrete logic using Boolean logic symbols. Logic 
diagrams should comply with ISA S5.3 – Binary Logic Diagrams. A binary logic diagram is located on 
page D-3. 
 
10-9.  Control schematics 
 
Control schematics show the interface between the SCADA system and the internal wiring of related 
equipment such as motor starters, pump control panels, generator control panels, etc. Proper development 
of control schematics requires a significant effort on the part of the SCADA system integrator because the 
standard drawings provided by manufacturers of these related system drawings are typically inconsistent 
in format, symbols and content, requiring that they be redrafted by the integrator to provide an integrated 
documentation package.  Symbols used on control schematics should comply with the previously refer-
enced ISA standards and ANSI Y14.15. – Electrical and Electronic Diagrams. 
  
10-10.  PLC program listing 
 
A documented listing of the complete program of each PLC should be provided. Documentation should 
consist of an English-language description of the function of each logic rung inserted into the listing.  
 
10-11.  Change control 
 
All SCADA documentation should include creation date, issue date, revision data, and revision history in 
a format that is consistent across all documents. A document database or spreadsheet should be main-
tained that provides a current listing of all documents and their revision status.  
 
a. The database should include the following: 
 
(1) Document Type 
 

TM 5-601 
10-4 
(2) Document Number 
 
(3) Page Number 
 
(4) Sheet Number 
 
(5) Title 
 
(6) Current Revision 
 
(7) Revision Date 
 
b. Each submittal of SCADA documentation should include an updated submittal of the document da-
tabase. The database should be provided in electronic format and maintained on an ongoing basis by the 
facility manager after system commissioning. All changes made to the system should be promptly re-
flected by revising the documentation and the database and distributing copies of the revised documenta-
tion and updated database to the field.

CHAPTER 11 
PROJECT PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION 
 
11-1. General planning 
 
This chapter has two objectives: to outline the basic process and key issues in planning, design, construc-
tion and commissioning of a SCADA project; and to summarize key points from the rest of the technical 
manual in a way that can serve as a checklist for the facility manager during the implementation process. 
References to other chapters of this TM are given in parentheses.  The implementation process may be 
considered to include the following six stages. Each of these stages contains key milestones that must be 
met and issues that must be addressed and resolved before moving on to the next stage.  
 
a. Project team selection 
 
b. Project initiation 
 
     c.  Requirements definition 
 
d.  System design 
 
e.  Construction 
 
f.  Commissioning 
 
11-2. Project team selection 
 
The following key personnel or their representatives make up the recommended project implementation 
team. Although time commitment and degree of involvement will vary with the stage of the project, all 
team members should be involved from the planning stage and remain in the communications loop 
throughout the duration of the project. It is a mistake to delay the involvement of maintenance staff or the 
commissioning agent until the end of the design stage or the construction stage; making changes at this 
late stage based on their input will undoubtedly impact schedule and cost. If the procurement method used 
allows it, involving the installing contractor(s) from the start is also beneficial. 
 
a. Project manager 
 
b. Facility manager 
 
c. Operations and maintenance manager 
 
d. Controls technician 
 
e. Mission commander 
 
f. Utility system designer(s) 
 
g. SCADA system designer 
 
h. Physical security specialist 

TM 5-601 
11-2 
 
i. Information security specialist 
 
j. Reliability analyst 
 
k. Commissioning agent 
 
11-3. Project initiation 
 
The objective of the project initiation stage is to assemble the team, focus them on the objectives of the 
project as a common mission, and put in place the tools necessary for the team to accomplish that mis-
sion. Specific tasks that must be accomplished for the project to move forward effectively include: 
 
a. Define the project scope and schedule. 
 
b. Establish the communication processes to be followed. 
 
c. Establish a document management system. 
 
d. Establish a process for tracking issues and documenting their resolution. 
 
11-4. Requirements definition 
 
The objective of the requirements definition stage is to clearly define the criteria which will serve as the 
basis for design of the system. The result should be a written design basis document against which the 
design can be verified as it progresses. Meeting the criteria defined in this stage becomes the primary 
measure of the technical success of the project.   
 
a. Top level criteria: 
 
(1) Reliability, Availability, Maintainability (RAM) criteria matched to mission chapter 5. 
 
(2) Configuration and level of redundancy matched to M/E system design (paragraph 3-9). 
 
(3) Type of HMI and extent of manual control capability matched to staffing levels and qualifica-
tions (chapter 6). 
 
(4) Established design standards for C4ISR facilities (appendix A). 
 
(5) Physical security policies (paragraph 7-3). 
 
(6) Information/network security policies (paragraph 7-4). 
 
b. Detail level criteria: 
 
(1) M/E systems sequence of operations/control strategy clearly defined (paragraph 10-4). 
 
(2) Required failure states of all valves and other equipment identified (paragraph 10-4). 
 
(3) Define all contingency conditions to be protected against (paragraph 10-4). 
 

TM 5-601 
 
11-3 
(4) Determine data presentation format, number of screens, etc. (chapter 6). 
 
(5)  Physical security provisions defined (paragraph 7-3). 
 
(6) Information/network security provisions defined (paragraph 7-4). 
 
11-5. Design 
 
The objective of the design stage is to translate the design basis document into a system design and docu-
ment the design clearly and completely so that it can be constructed properly, commissioned completely, 
and operated and maintained reliably and efficiently. The primary criteria for design documents should be 
completeness of detail and clarity of design intent. The system should be fully designed during this stage, 
where careful review can take place, rather than leaving details to be “worked out” in the field during 
construction and commissioning.  
 
a. Key issues to be addressed in this stage include: 
 
(1) Develop a system architecture schematic or block-diagram drawing (chapter 3). 
 
(2) Select network communications media (fiber optic, etc.) appropriate to the physical and electri-
cal environments (paragraph 4-2). 
 
(3) Analyze the proposed architecture to verify it meets the RAM criteria (chapter 4 and paragraph 
5-2). 
 
(4) Select system vendor(s) and hardware considering; 
 
(a) In-service history 
 
(b) Vendor support 
 
(c) RAM data 
 
(d) Staff experience 
 
b Detailed design documents should be formally reviewed by all team members at established points 
in the design process. The number of review submittals may vary with the size and complexity of the pro-
ject, but a minimum of two submittals prior to completion is recommended. These reviews should verify 
the following: 
 
(1) All symbols, abbreviations and line types are clearly defined (paragraph 10-2). 
 
(2) A complete and consistent equipment and cable identification (tag number) scheme is used 
(paragraph 10-2). 
 
(3) Loop and Binary Logic Diagrams or Descriptions are provided (paragraphs 10-7 and 10-8). 
 
(4) A complete input/output points list has been provided (paragraph 10-6). 
 
(5) Open protocols and readily available hardware are specified (paragraphs 3-6 and 4-4). 
 

TM 5-601 
11-4 
(6) Design has been analyzed for reliability, availability and maintainability criteria (chapter 5). 
 
(7) Power supplies match system RAM and redundancy levels (paragraph 5-6).  
 
(8) Physical segregation exists between redundant components and paths (paragraph 3-9 and 5-7). 
 
(9) Layout of operator controls and indicators and HMI screens has been clearly specified for hu-
man factors considerations (paragraph 6-5).  
 
(10) Environmental protection level of devices and enclosures is clearly specified and appropriate 
for their location (paragraph 7-1). 
 
(11) The design of the grounding and surge protection system is clearly detailed and specified 
(paragraph 7-2). 
 
(12) Control equipment is located within secure spaces (paragraph 7-3). 
 
(13) External communication links are secure (paragraph 7-4). 
 
(14) The design includes all test and measurement provisions needed for commissioning (chapter 
8). 
 
(15) All components can be tested and maintained without interrupting the mission (paragraph 9-3). 
 
(16) Physical security provisions are clearly defined (paragraph 7-3). 
 
(17) Information/network security provisions are clearly defined (paragraph 7-4). 
 
11-6. Construction 
 
The objective of the construction stage is to install and place into operation the SCADA system hardware 
and software in compliance with the design documents. This stage should utilize standard construction 
management tools and techniques for managing schedule, cost, contract changes, etc. However, for a 
SCADA project, there are some additional considerations that must be addressed:  
 
a.  A change management process should be established assuring that all field issues receive appropri-
ate technical review (paragraph 10-11).  
 
b.  All changes should be documented on an ongoing basis, and design documents kept current, rather 
than leaving this to an end-of-project “as-built drawings” task (paragraph 10-11). 
 
c.  Operations and maintenance data should be assembled and reviewed during the construction process 
and must be complete prior to commissioning (paragraph 9-5). 
 
11-7. Commissioning 
 
The objective of the commissioning stage is to obtain formal verification that the installed SCADA sys-
tem complies with and performs in accordance with the design intent as defined in the Design Basis and 
the detailed design documents. Key aspects of commissioning include: 
 
a. Preparation of a commissioning plan (paragraph 8-1). 

TM 5-601 
 
11-5 
 
b. Factory acceptance testing of PLC hardware and software (paragraph 8-2).  
 
c. Integrity testing of installed devices and conductors (paragraph 8-3). 
 
d. Instrument calibration and loop verification (paragraphs 8-4 and 8-5). 
 
e. Preparation and review of test procedures (paragraphs 8-2, 8-3 and 8-6). 
 
f. Functional performance testing (paragraph 8-6). 
 
g. Verification of physical and information/network security provisions (paragraphs 7-3 and 7-5). 
 
h. Verification of complete system documentation (chapter 10)

1.  Glossary 
 
-A- 
 
ALTERNATING CURRENT (AC).  Refers to an electrical system in which the supply voltage, and thus 
the current flowing is a load, alternates polarity at a specified frequency.  Alternating current systems are 
typically supplied from rotating electrical generators. 
 
AVAILABILITY.  A measure of the degree to which an item is in an operable and commitable state at 
the start of a mission when the mission is called for at an unknown (random) time.  (Item state at start of a 
mission includes the combined effects of the readiness-related system reliability and maintainability pa-
rameters, but excludes mission time.)  (MIL-STD-721C, now canceled).  In its simplest definition, avail-
ability is uptime divided by downtime.  In terms of reliability (MTBF or and maintainability (Mean Time 
to Repair or Mean Downtime), inherent and operational availability are defined as: 
 
Ao.  Operational Availability.  The percentage of time that a system is available for use based on its op-
erational reliability and maintainability, and logistics factors, such as delay times.  Usually defined by the 
following steady-state equation: 
 
MDT+MTBM
MTBM =  Ao  
 
Ai.  Inherent Availability.  The percentage of time that a system is available for use based only on its in-
herent reliability and maintainability characteristics.  Usually defined by the following steady-state equa-
tion: 
 
MTTR+MTBF
MTBF A  i =
 
 
-C- 
 
COAXIAL CABLE (COAX).  A cable construction in which a single copper conductor is insulated and 
then covered with a concentric braided copper shield which also serves as a current carrying conductor. 
 
COMMISSIONING. The process of verifying and documenting that systems or equipment perform in 
accordance with their specifications and design intent. 
 
CONTROL SELECTIVITY.  The degree to which a control can be manipulated without accidentally ac-
tivating other controls.  A common problem is to position buttons or keys too closely, leading to the 
wrong button being pressed.
